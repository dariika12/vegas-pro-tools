Quick Start Guide
- Create a simple project
  - Start a new project in Vegas Pro. Import a few clips and create a basic timeline with simple transitions.
  - Use the GPU-accelerated paths by enabling the related setting in the plugin options.
  - Save the project to ensure you can test nested timelines.

- Create a nested timeline
  - Select a sequence of clips and effects you want to reuse.
  - Create a new nested timeline and give it a descriptive name.
  - Place the nested timeline in your main timeline where needed.
  - Make a small change to the nested timeline and observe how it updates in the parent timeline.

- Script a basic task
  - Open the scripting interface and write a small script to batch-apply an effect to several clips or to export a subset of media.
  - Run the script to see the automation in action.
  - Save the script for reuse and share it in your project library for teammates.

- Example workflow
  - Import media, build a project structure with nested timelines, apply a GPU-accelerated color grade to the nested timeline, and render the final output using GPU-accelerated rendering.
  - Use scripts to prepare proxies, adjust project settings, and post-process the output.

Workflows and Use Cases
- Large multi-sequence projects
  - Use nested timelines to manage sections of a large project. Create standard components for intros, outros, and b-roll sequences to reuse across projects.
  - Keep project files lean by referencing nested timelines rather than duplicating sequences.

- Reusable edits and templates
  - Build templates that contain common transitions, color grades, and effects. Save templates as nested timelines and reuse them in different projects.
  - Scripts can automatically populate templates with media from a folder structure, drastically reducing setup time.

- Automated media management
  - Use scripts to organize media based on metadata, rename files, move assets to project folders, and generate proxies for heavy media.
  - Automate checks for missing files and report inconsistencies in a project.

- Batch rendering
  - Create scripts to render batches of timelines or nested timelines with specific output settings. This is helpful for completing multiple versions of a project or exporting assets for multiple platforms.

- Proxies and offline workflows
  - Generate proxies for heavy media. Switch to GPU-accelerated playback when proxies are replaced with full-resolution media.

- Collaboration
  - Share nested timelines and scripts as assets. Use the library to synchronize components across a teamâ€™s projects.
